THE HOLISTIC DEVELOPMENT</u></h1><br>
<font size="5">
The school aims to nurture children who are compassionate, respectful, caring and loving. It is the mission and vision of Dr (Mrs) Amita Chauhan,
<br>Chairperson, Amity Group of Schools and RBEF that all our students, teachers, principals, parents and management synergise together in 
<br>thought and action in the common quest for self-discovery and self-learning. Regular interactions with influential dignitaries, activities like havan, recital
<br>of shlokas, harmonious celebration of festive occasions, Spic Macay demonstrations, environment clubs, etc bring a multidimensional and holistic
 <br>framework to the school's curriculum.<br>
